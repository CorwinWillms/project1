        Hello Dr. Stewart! Here is where I will justify how my website follows the guidelines
        on the assignment page, if you have questions let me know and I will do my best to explain.
        The numbers below correspond directly to the numbers on the assignment, meaning 1. here is my
        explanation for why I fulfilled requirement 1, etc.
        <br>

    <ol>
        <li>
            This website is for my little sister who is planning to pursue musical theatre. A portfolio
            website like this is extremely helpful for getting noticed by artists in different locations
            where one may be unable to specifically hand over a resume.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            My content is not lifted from other sites because that is my sister's face and all photos 
            and videos were taken by my mom and she said I can use them (I promise I asked)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The five pages my website has are <b>Home, About, Media, Gallery</b>, and <b>Contact</b>, 
            as evident from the tabs in the nav bar at the top of the page. If you look at the url 
            for the Home page, you can see its content is from the index.html file.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            There is a lovely <b><span style="color:darkcyan">dark cyan</span></b> header across the 
            top of the website that lists the names of the different pages on the website! How fun 
            and functional!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            It would be quite lame of me to have so many fun website pages with no way to access them
            unless you knew what my html file names are, so I graciously linked them to the 
            corresponding nav bar section.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            With all the work I put into making the different pages accessible, wouldn't it be terrible
            if they got cut off from the nav bar when the window/screen was smaller? Well, never fear!
            At a certain screen size, the bar switches to a dropdown so it doesn't cut off any of the 
            lovely website content.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            All of the different pages have the OG style.css linked (as well as their own style sheets
            for unique elements) that covers the design of the nav bar, the header, the screen size
            adjustments, and the footer!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            What would a portfolio website be without images of the lovely actor in question? There are
            many images of Bridget present here on this website, all of which containing an alt
            attribute describing generally what is going on for those who cannot or choose not to see
            said images.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Since my sister is going into musical theatre, what more appropriate favicon could there be
            than the classic comedy and drama masks? You will see those present on every page of the
            website because who needs the random world icon when we could have theatre instead?
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Organization is beautiful and honestly with all the dang image files I have on this website
            I would have put them all into folders anyway so the VS Code explorer tab didn't give me 
            anxiety every time I looked at it. I did not use any JavaScript files, but if you look in 
            the head sections of every page you will see that the href attribute is for css/ whatever
            the stylesheet name is. The same applies for the images; they are all images/ whatever I
            named the file.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I don't really know how to prove that I didn't use any third-party resources or additional
            languages and stuff other than that it would probably look a lot less like someone's first
            ever web dev project if I did. I'm proud of my website don't get me wrong but yeah I feel 
            like you can tell it was made from scratch in html and css.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I ran each page through the validator link and it said it was good so I trusted it, I don't
            think there's much more to say about that!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I think the content looks very lovely alignment-wise. I did favor center alignment more than
            right and left because the intention and layout of my content was more conducive to
            centering but I still think it looks neat.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            As far as I can tell everything is consistent and nothing bleeds over at any point!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I use a few different fonts in my website: the headers are in Lucidia Handwriting, the
            nav bar tabs are in Sans Serif, the footer quote is in Georgia, and the filler text in the
            contact form is in Arial.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I have a form on the contact section of the website that does not go anywhere at the moment
            but once I learn now to do that my mom and I plan to have that link to a specific email
            box for Bridget's professional inquiries! Fun stuff :)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            On the media section of the website, there is a link to my mom's youtube channel that
            pretty much exclusively has videos of Bridget performing. The two embedded videos are from
            her most recent performance which is why they are the ones we want site visitors to see
            first before looking at some of her older performances rom youtube.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I made sure to use proper tab spacing in every file, I move text sections to different
            lines in the file so the bottom scroll bar isn't huge, and I used kebab-case or underscores
            in the names for everything.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            On the homepage, I animated the header to change colors between a few of my sister's
            favorite ones that also looked decent with the background and other website content. It
            looks pretty fun in my opinion!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I did indeed share the repository with you, I don't remember if you accepted the invite
            but that's as far in the process as I could take it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            My file names are all just letters, save for the images where I used underscores to 
            separate words to make it more readable.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            It took me way longer than it should have to force the https connection because I put an
            extra space in the .conf file and couldn't find it for the longest time but it does work
            and both http:// and https:// direct to my funky fresh website.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I followed Dr. Johnson's steps to use Let's Encrypt for the free certificate and it does
            work the way I intend.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I think this requirement is the same as #22 so yes I did it!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I feel like I have a decent amount of days represented in my pushes, sometimes I forgot to
            push for a day or so since I had been looking at the live server to make sure everything
            was formatting how I wanted but I definitely didn't wait to push everything until the last
            day.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If you're reading this, that means I fulfilled the requirement it specifies #meta
        </li>
